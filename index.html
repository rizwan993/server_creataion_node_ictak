    <h4>What is a Digital Life?</h4>
    <span>Digital Life is a research and educational program about radically rethinking of the human-computer interactive experience. It integrates digital world (information & services) and physical world (physical objects/environment). </span>
    <span>It makes interfaces more responsive and proactive (objects & environments monitor user and (proactively) present information & services relevant to userâ€™s current needs/interests)</span>
